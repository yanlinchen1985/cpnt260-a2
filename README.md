I met many problems when I coded, because it is pretty new field for me.  This time , I spent a lot of time when I did the footer. I uesd the **justify-content: space-evenly;  ** in CSS, but it could not work well because the left room seemed too bigger than other. So I checked it by using Firefox tool. Then I used **margin-left:-40px;** to fix it. However, I am not sure it is a good idea. There were others problems,and I am still busy with the structure of the HTML and CSS file. Second, it includes so many details so that I fixed it when I double checked the requirements. I think the assignments are very helpful for me to review. Third,I added the reminders in CSS file when I saw your message on slack. I did not have the habit to use reminders which is really good for me to review in my coding, so I decide to use it more later.

Actually ,I felt our class seems hard because of my language, so I needed to work on it by searching the knowledge points after our class. Sometimes I am shy to ask so for many problems, so I tried my best to fix in many ways suggested online. Some of them are right, but some of them can not work well.  I knew there might be many problems in my assignments, but I would like to try more. 

Tony, thank you for your teaching. Even though this program is challenging, I find it is interesting and so cool when I created each web page!
